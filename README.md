# DSA-visualizer
step-by-step visualization of DSA algorithms using C/python.
# DSA Visualizer

DSA Visualizer is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the working of
basic Data Structures and Algorithms through step-by-step visualization using Python.
The goal of this project is to build strong fundamentals and understand how algorithms
work internally rather than just memorizing code.
